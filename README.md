# XAI-in-Commodity-Forecasting

This work aims to train machine learning models using a specifically constructed dataset of thirty-year daily time series of the major financial assets in the United States. 
The goal is to classify economic scenarios in order to apply the most suitable trading operational strategy to the identified scenario.

Additionally, given the critical nature of the financial context in which decisions are made, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) algorithms will be employed to make these decisions transparent and interpretable.
