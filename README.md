# XAI-in-Commodity-Forecasting

In this work, after constructing a dataset composed of thirty-year daily time series of the major commodities traded on financial markets and some of the key assets in the U.S. stock, currency, and bond markets, machine learning models will be trained with the goal of classifying economic scenarios to apply the most suitable trading operational strategy for the identified scenario.

Additionally, given the critical nature of the financial context in which decisions are made, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) algorithms will be employed to make these decisions transparent and interpretable.
